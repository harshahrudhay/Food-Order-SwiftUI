# Food-Order-SwiftUI

🍔 Food Ordering App (Core Data)
A food ordering app built using SwiftUI and Core Data, created to explore Core Data’s capabilities for local data management. In this app, users can place orders, and admins can view and manage those orders, all stored locally on the device. The app doesn’t rely on external services like Firebase — the entire process, from order creation to management, is handled through Core Data for offline storage and fast access.
Features:
- 🍕 User Order Placement: Users can browse and place food orders.
- 🍽️ Admin Order Management: Admins can view, update, and manage user orders.
- 💾 Core Data Integration: All orders are stored locally using Core Data, providing offline capabilities.
- 🔒 No Cloud Services: Entirely self-contained, with no need for external databases or cloud services.
- 📱 SwiftUI Interface: User-friendly interface built with SwiftUI, providing a smooth and modern experience.
- 📚 Learning Core Data: Developed as a personal project to learn and implement Core Data for local storage.
