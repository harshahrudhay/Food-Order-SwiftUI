# Food-Order-SwiftUI
This food ordering app is built using SwiftUI and Core Data, designed as a learning project to explore local data management with Core Data. The app allows users to place food orders, while admins can view and manage those orders. All data is stored locally on the device, with no need for external services like Firebase or cloud databases.
